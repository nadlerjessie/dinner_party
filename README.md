# Bring It

Having trouble organizing a dinner party or potluck? Our app helps with the invitations, menu planning, and organizing who is bringing what. 

== Motivation

For our first rails app at the Flatiron School we wanted to build a program that was easy to use and organized many different logistics with hosting a dinner party or potluck.

== Installation

Bring It is currently only available if you're using Facebook's Developer Tools and is run locally in rails. 

== Features

Bring it allows you to host and/or attend dinner parties. 
-A user will sign in with Facebook, can host a dinner and invite friends. 
-The host creates a menu and choose what they plan to provide. 
-The guests will see which parties they have been invited to (and parties they're hosting, if any at all!) and details for the dinner. 
-Every guest can see their host's menu and choose what they'd like to bring. 
-Once something is taken off the menu it won't be available for future guests, so the host doesn't need to worry about having everyone bring the same thing!
-Recipe recommendations are provided based on menu selections. This is done through the Food2Fork API.
